## Introduction
This is a light python project for programming distributed machine learning algorithm easily, there are three key objects we want to achieve:
* Easy Programming. You can transform one machine learning algorithm distirbuted easily, which means that you will add as less codes as possible for the parallelization of one current sequential ML algorithm.
* Well Scalability. We support the increase of data and machines. You can process bigger data using more processors, which means that with the increase in the number of processors, the running time of your algorithm on the same data will decrease, and as long as your cluster is big enough, you can process as big data as you want in acceptable time
*
