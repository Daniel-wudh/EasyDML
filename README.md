## Introduction
    This is a light python project for programming distributed machine learning algorithm easily, there are three key objects we want to achieve:
* Easy Programming, you can transform one machine learning algorithm distirbuted easily, which means that you will add as less codes as possible for the parallelization of one current sequential ML algorithm.
*
